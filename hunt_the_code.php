                                            Hunt the Code is a online programming competition which is conducted by NIT HAMIRPUR.<br>

This competition is conducted by Team.exe (Departmental Team of Computer Science and Engineering of NIT Hamirpur) for NIMBUS (Technical Festival of NIT Hamirpur).<br>

In this event, you are given an executable file of the pre-written code and the instructions about the input. One has to find the logic behind the executable code and write the program for it.<br>

There are six programming problems in the contest with varying difficulty. The contest is 3 days long, and 2 questions will be added everyday. 2 hints will be posted on Hackerearth - first hint at 5:30pm and second hint at 7:30pm.<br>

Anyone with plagiarism in result will be disqualified from the event.<br>

Anyone with a knack for programming can participate in this contest. There are no restrictions.<br>
